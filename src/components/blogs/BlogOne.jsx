        What Is AI-Powered Waste Sorting?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        AI-powered waste sorting uses computer vision and machine learning to
        identify and sort waste materials.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Image Recognition:</strong> Using cameras and sensors, AI
          scans items on a conveyor belt, recognizing materials by shape, color,
          and texture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deep Learning:</strong> Through convolutional neural networks
          (CNNs), the system learns to classify objects over time with
          increasing accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Real-Time Decisions:</strong> These systems don’t wait. They
          analyze and act in milliseconds, identifying recyclable PET plastic
          from contaminated paper without missing a beat.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        AI enables precision. Traditional manual sorting can't compete with the
        speed and accuracy AI brings to the table.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
        How Robotics Are Transforming Facilities
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Robotic Arms:</strong> AI-driven robotic arms make up to 80
          picks per minute. Some systems claim speeds of 6,000 picks per hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Smart Integration:</strong> These robots work hand-in-hand
          with optical sorters and AI software to improve sorting performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hybrid Operations:</strong> Facilities are combining human
          oversight with robotic consistency to tackle the complexity of waste
          streams.
        </li>
      </ul>
