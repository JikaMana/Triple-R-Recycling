              You can't fix what you don't understand. That's the brutal truth
              about the waste crisis gripping communities across Nigeria and
              beyond. Every overflowing bin, every clogged drainage, every
              backyard pile of plastic bottles—these are symptoms of something
              deeper: a collective knowledge gap.

              This blog uncovers why waste literacy isn't just a buzzword. It's
              the first—and most important—step toward mobilizing communities,
              sparking change, and creating a cleaner, healthier environment. If
              you're a school leader, community advocate, or just tired of
              seeing your street littered with PET bottles, this one's for you.

              What is Waste Literacy, and Why Should You Care?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Waste literacy is the understanding of what waste is, how it's
              generated, how to sort it, and what happens when we fail to manage
              it responsibly. But more than facts and figures, it's about
              connecting everyday actions with long-term consequences.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              When people understand why their behavior matters—why tossing
              sachets on the road adds to flooding, or why burning plastics
              affects public health—they begin to care. And when they care, they
              act.

              Every lasting change begins with a moment of clarity. For many,
              that moment comes when they learn just how long plastic takes to
              degrade (hint: it's longer than any of us will live).

              Community education—whether through school programs, neighborhood
              meetings, or radio jingles—transforms waste from a silent problem
              to a shared responsibility.

              Conclusion: Knowledge is the Real Waste Solution

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The journey to a cleaner, safer, more sustainable Nigeria starts
              with one simple but powerful idea: education changes everything.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              If you want to build a community that cares, you have to teach
              them why and how to care.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              That's why Triple R Recycling Ltd is investing in waste education
              for households, schools, and radio stations. We believe that the
              more people understand waste, the less of it there will be.

              or local airwaves, let's talk. Because together, we can turn
              knowledge into action—and action into lasting change.
