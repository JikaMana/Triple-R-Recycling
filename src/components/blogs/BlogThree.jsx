          You can't fix what you don’t understand. That’s the brutal truth about
          the waste crisis across Nigeria and beyond. Every overflowing bin and
          clogged drainage is rooted in a collective knowledge gap.
        </p>

        <p>
          This blog uncovers why waste literacy isn’t just a buzzword. It’s the
          first step to mobilizing communities, sparking change, and creating
          cleaner cities.

          What is Waste Literacy, and Why Should You Care?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Waste literacy is the knowledge of how waste is generated, sorted, and
          managed. More than facts—it links actions to consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Triple R Recycling Ltd, we’ve seen that awareness empowers action.
          When people understand the "why," they start to care—and act.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">
          Awareness is the Starting Line
        </h2>
        <p>
          Plastic takes longer than a lifetime to degrade. Realizing that
          transforms waste from a silent nuisance to a shared issue.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>PTAs in Abuja now sort waste after workshops</li>
          <li>Radio listeners call in with recycling ideas</li>
          <li>
            Secondary schools now include waste topics in their curriculum
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>When people understand waste, they ask: “What can I do?”</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">
          Participation Grows When People Know What to Do
        </h2>
        <p>Waste literacy teaches:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>What’s recyclable and what’s not</li>
          <li>How to separate organic from dry waste</li>
          <li>Where to drop recyclables properly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We’ve seen neighbors become recycling champions after simple training.
          Once they get it—momentum builds.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">
          Good Habits Start Early—and Spread
        </h2>
        <p>
          Schools normalize good habits early. Kids bring lessons home, streets
          get cleaner, and movements grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          A 10-year-old reminding their parents to sort food from PET bottles?
          That’s change in motion.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">
          Civic Engagement Needs Informed Citizens
        </h2>
        <p>Waste-literate citizens are more likely to:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Push for better waste infrastructure</li>
          <li>Report illegal dumping</li>
          <li>Lead advocacy or recycling clubs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Waste education turns silent frustration into civic power. At Triple
          R, we support grassroots advocates to drive this change.
